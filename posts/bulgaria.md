# Travel Log: Bulgaria

*March 15, 2024*

Last month, I spent two weeks exploring Bulgaria, a country with rich history and stunning landscapes. Here are some highlights from my trip.

## Sofia: Where Ancient Meets Modern

The capital city is a fascinating mix of Roman ruins, Ottoman architecture, and Soviet-era monuments. The Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, with its golden domes, is particularly impressive at sunset.

## Hiking in the Rila Mountains

The Seven Rila Lakes hike was challenging but rewarding. Each lake has its own character:
- The Tear
- The Eye
- The Kidney
- The Twin
- The Trefoil
- The Fish Lake
- The Lower Lake

## Local Cuisine

Bulgarian food was a delightful surprise. Some favorites:
- Banitsa (cheese-filled pastry)
- Shopska salad
- Kebapche
- Ayran (yogurt drink)

## Tech Scene

I was impressed by Sofia's growing tech community. Met several founders working on interesting blockchain projects. The low cost of living and high quality of life make it an attractive hub for remote workers.
