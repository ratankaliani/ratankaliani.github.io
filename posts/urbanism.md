# Urbanism

I love cities and how immense the aggregated output of all the people within it are.

Walking across San Franacisco to get a gauge to the most beautiful places in SF is quite difficult, but I just can't stop appreciating how incredible the city is.

A few steps away are incredible deli's, and way more.

What do I want in this point in time?

I'm a big fan of urbanism, but the content around is quite lacking. Often, it takes a passive view on city design. The
goal is to create a place to have urbanism in a clearer way.
